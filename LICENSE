                            Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. This License applies to most of the Free
Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply
it to your programs, too.
